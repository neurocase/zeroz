this is my sidescroller game ZeroZ

as in, there is no Z axis in sidescrollers.

yay.

this works with libGDX, go into elcipse / android development environment and go -> File -> Import -> [General] Existing projects into workspace

RoboVm is the iOS thing
HTML is converted from java with gwt

Android hasn't been tested or yet, however it should work fine as soon as I add the appropriate controls, will put more info later.
